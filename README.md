Hello, here is an Imgui of a setting menu for S4League, current settings working FOV/FPS edit, you must put into the client folder the config.json
in this folder, and must use the below DLL named: fps.dll the fps.dll will fix the physics and unlock fps and the menu will allow you to edit in Game by pressing DEL to open and close the menu.

All my settings are already here on .vs.rar make sure you add this to the project folder and you might need to change some routes since my user is different.

My route is: C:\migui\imgui 
If you create those folders and add the project there you probably won't have to change any routes.


You must install: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812 to build the dll.

I will leave below a folder name: Compiled DLLs with the Imgui and fps.dll in case don't want to compile yourself.
